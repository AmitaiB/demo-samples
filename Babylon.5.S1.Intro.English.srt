42
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,420
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind...

43
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:07,673
...10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

44
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:11,093
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

45
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,346
Its goal: to prevent another war
by creating a place...

46
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,601
...where humans and aliens
could work out their differences.

47
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:21,937
It's a port of call,
home away from home...

48
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:26,650
...for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

49
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:30,988
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons...

50
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:36,327
...of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

51
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,621
It can be a dangerous place.

52
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:41,832
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

53
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:45,502
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

54
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:48,005
The year is 2258.

55
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:54,261
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
